# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to 
isualize them in action through a graph which is easier to see the moves.

### Available sorts
- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Selection sort 
- [x] Quick sort
- [ ] Shuffle sort (WiP)

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
